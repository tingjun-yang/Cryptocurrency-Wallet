# Cryptocurrency Wallet

In this project, we build an application called KryptoJobs2Go. The customers can use the application to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates.

After launching the KryptoJobs2Go application through `streamlit run krypto_jobs.py`, we see there are four fintech professionals available to be hired. Their Ethereum account addresses, KryptoJobs2Go ratings, hourly rates per Ether are also shown.
